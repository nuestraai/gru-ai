## What Is gruAI?

Most AI coding tools put you in the driver's seat — prompting, reviewing, re-prompting, clarifying, re-clarifying. You become a full-time AI babysitter.

gruAI flips this. You are the CEO. You hand down a directive ("add dark mode to the dashboard"), and a team of named AI agents handles the rest:

1. Your CTO audits the codebase. C-suite agents **brainstorm approaches, argue trade-offs, and challenge your assumptions** — then clarify with you before anyone writes code.
2. Your COO decomposes the work, assigns builders and reviewers. Engineers build. Reviewers review with fresh context. A mechanical gate blocks shipping until all reviews pass.
3. You get a digest: files changed, tests passed, review summary. Approve or reopen.

The system is designed for **depth, not speed.** Agents accumulate institutional memory across directives — lessons learned, design rationale, standing corrections. Your 10th directive runs better than your 1st because the team remembers what went wrong.

---

## Why Is the Output Better?

Every point below traces to published research from Anthropic and OpenAI. This isn't a workflow we invented — it's assembled from what the research says actually works.

- **Agents brainstorm and argue before anyone writes code.** For strategic directives, your C-suite agents independently propose approaches, then deliberate — challenging assumptions, resolving disagreements, and surfacing questions for you. Anthropic's research found [multi-agent outperformed single-agent by 90.2%](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/multi-agent-research-system). The pipeline implements their [orchestrator-workers pattern](https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents) where specialized agents collaborate, producing better results than any single agent.

- **Reviewers evaluate intent, not just code.** Each reviewer gets [fresh context](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-context-engineering-for-ai-agents) scoped to the task — they never see the builder's reasoning, preventing confirmation bias. They verify against your Definition of Done (what you asked for), not just whether the code compiles. This is Anthropic's [evaluator-optimizer pattern](https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents): one agent generates, another evaluates, issues get fixed in-loop — not after the fact.

- **Context is isolated, not accumulated.** Each agent spawns with a [clean context window](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-context-engineering-for-ai-agents) scoped to exactly what it needs. No 200K-token sessions where the model forgets what it read at the start. Anthropic's context engineering research shows accuracy degrades as token count increases — gruAI treats context as a finite resource under active degradation.

- **Verification is mechanical.** Bash scripts — not LLMs — enforce pipeline integrity: schema validation, self-review prevention, step dependency checks, role assignment verification. This follows Anthropic's [poka-yoke principle](https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents) (error-proof design) and OpenAI's finding that [invariants should be enforced through structural tests](https://openai.com/index/harness-engineering/), not judgment.

- **The harness determines output quality, not model intelligence.** Anthropic found that ["the task verifier must be nearly perfect, otherwise the agent solves the wrong problem"](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-c-compiler). OpenAI's team reached the same conclusion: [3 engineers produced 1M lines of code](https://openai.com/index/harness-engineering/) not by writing better prompts, but by designing better environments and feedback loops. gruAI's 15-step pipeline IS that harness.

- **Memory compounds across directives.** Lessons, design rationale, and standing corrections persist in `.context/` and get loaded into every future agent. This implements the [codified context pattern](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20478) — hot-memory + specialized agents + cold-memory knowledge base.

## Every Step Has a Reason

Each pipeline step implements a specific recommendation from the research:

| What the Research Says | Source | What gruAI Does |
|------------------------|--------|-----------------|
| Start simple, add complexity only when needed | [Building Effective Agents](https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents) | **Triage** classifies by weight — lightweight auto-approves, strategic gets full deliberation |
| Context rot: accuracy degrades as tokens increase | [Context Engineering](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-context-engineering-for-ai-agents) | Each agent gets **fresh, scoped context** — never a 200K-token accumulated session |
| Multi-agent outperformed single-agent by 90.2% | [Multi-Agent Research](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/multi-agent-research-system) | C-suite agents **brainstorm independently**, then **deliberate and argue** |
| Give a map, not a 1,000-page manual | [Harness Engineering](https://openai.com/index/harness-engineering/) | CLAUDE.md is a ~100-line pointer file. Detail lives in `.context/` loaded just-in-time |
| Task verifier must be nearly perfect | [Building a C Compiler](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-c-compiler) | **Review gate** mechanically blocks completion without review artifacts |
| One agent generates, another evaluates in a loop | [Building Effective Agents](https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents) | Builder → code review → fix → standard review → fix → **review gate** |
| Sub-agents return condensed results with clean context | [Context Engineering](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-context-engineering-for-ai-agents) | Builders return structured reports. Reviewers never see builder reasoning |
| Persistent state survives session death | [Building a C Compiler](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-c-compiler) | `directive.json` IS the checkpoint — any session reads it and resumes |
| Human review at trust boundaries only | [Building a C Compiler](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-c-compiler) | CEO gates at **approve** and **completion** — not at every step |
| Guardrails enable speed, not impede it | [Harness Engineering](https://openai.com/index/harness-engineering/) | Every skipped step eventually caused a failure — lightweight still runs verification |

---

## The Pipeline

15 steps across 5 phases. The weight system adapts: lightweight tasks skip brainstorming and auto-approve. Strategic tasks get the full process with CEO gates.

**Intake:** Triage → Checkpoint → Read | **Analysis:** Context → Audit → Brainstorm | **Planning:** Clarification → Plan → Approve | **Execution:** Project Brainstorm → Setup → Execute | **Verification:** Review Gate → Wrapup → Completion

Hard gates (require approval): **Approve** (heavyweight/strategic only), **Review Gate** (all weights), **Completion** (all weights).

<details>
<summary><strong>Worked Example: "Rewrite the README"</strong></summary>

This README was built through the pipeline as a **strategic** directive:

| Step | What Happens |
|------|-------------|
| **Triage** | Classified as **strategic** — external research, cross-domain content decisions |
| **Audit** | The CTO identifies 10 messaging gaps and 3 existing assets |
| **Brainstorm** | CTO, CPO, and CMO independently propose approaches, then **argue trade-offs in a deliberation round**. All 3 reject "revolutionary" language. They disagree on line count and resolve at 250-350. They surface 3 questions for the CEO. |
| **Clarification** | CEO answers the 3 questions, adds constraint: "multi-platform is roadmap, not shipped" |
| **Plan** | COO assigns a content builder and a CMO reviewer |
| **Execute** | Builder researches 7 competitors, verifies citation URLs, writes README. Reviewer evaluates with fresh context — no builder reasoning. |
| **Review Gate** | Validation script confirms: no self-review, all 10 DOD criteria verified by reviewer |
| **Completion** | CEO reviews digest: approve, amend, or reopen |

For lighter work (e.g., "fix a typo"), the pipeline skips brainstorming and auto-approves — same verification, less ceremony.

## The Context Tree

All state lives in `.context/` at your repo root — plain markdown and JSON, version-controlled alongside your code.

```
.context/
├── directives/              # All work lives here
│   └── dark-mode/
│       ├── directive.json   # Pipeline state, weight, progress
│       ├── directive.md     # CEO brief
│       ├── audit.md         # CTO's technical audit
│       ├── brainstorm.md    # C-suite deliberation
│       └── projects/
│           └── dark-mode/
│               └── project.json  # Tasks, DOD, agents, reviews
├── lessons/                 # What went wrong (reactive)
├── design/                  # Why the system works this way (proactive)
├── intel/                   # External research from /scout
└── reports/                 # CEO digests
```

**Directive → Projects → Tasks.** A directive is a unit of work ("add dark mode"). The COO decomposes it into projects, each with tasks, agents, reviewers, and a Definition of Done. `directive.json` tracks pipeline progress — any session can read it and resume where it left off. `project.json` is the source of truth for what needs building and whether it passed review.

**Knowledge compounds.** Lessons, design rationale, and standing corrections persist across directives. Agents load relevant context just-in-time — not everything, just what they need for their role and task. No database, no external service — just files.

## Your Team

gruAI ships with 11 customizable agents. You are the CEO — everyone reports to you.

```

C-suite agents have **institutional memory** — lessons and corrections persist across directives. Engineers spawn per-task with fresh context. All agents are markdown files in `.claude/agents/` — add, rename, or customize freely.

## The Office

<!-- TODO: CEO — capture screenshot of the full dashboard showing the pixel-art office with HUD panels open. 1200px wide. -->
<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/dashboard-full.png" alt="gruAI pixel-art office dashboard" width="720" />
</p>

The dashboard is an interactive pixel-art office. Click agents to see their sessions. Click furniture (whiteboard, bookshelf, mailbox) to see brainstorms, knowledge base, and notifications. Four HUD tabs — Team, Tasks, Status, Log — show real-time directive progress, DOD tracking, and pipeline state. Every animation is tied to real session state: agents walk to desks when building, gather at the whiteboard when brainstorming, stand up when waiting for approval.

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/andrew-yangy/gruai.git
cd gruai && npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173). Then scaffold your AI team in Claude Code: `/gruai-agents`

Or: `npm install gru-ai && npx gru-ai`

gruAI currently works with **Claude Code**. Adapters for Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, and Aider are planned — the pipeline and dashboard are engine-agnostic by design.
