/**
 * CodexCLISpawnAdapter -- SpawnAdapter implementation for Codex CLI.
 *
 * Encapsulates the `codex -q` CLI invocation with support for both
 * detached (fire-and-forget) and tracked (await completion) spawn modes.
 *
 * Key differences from ClaudeCodeSpawnAdapter:
 * - No --agent flag. Codex uses a codex.md file for instructions, so before
 *   spawning we call the personality compiler to generate codex.md in cwd.
 * - No --dangerously-skip-permissions. Codex uses a sandbox by default.
 * - No --no-session-persistence. Codex manages its own sessions.
 * - Model selection is via config.toml, not a CLI flag.
