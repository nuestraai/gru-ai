# validate-cast.sh — Mechanical casting validation for the COO's plan JSON
#
# Validates that the COO's project cast follows the casting rules:
# 1. Every project must have at least one reviewer
# 2. Builder (agent) must not be in the reviewers array
# 3. Complex projects (5+ tasks) must have at least one C-suite reviewer
# 4. Agents don't review changes to their own behavior/prompts
# 5. depends_on references must point to existing project IDs
# 6. No circular dependencies in depends_on graph
#
# Usage: cat plan.json | ./validate-cast.sh
#    or: ./validate-cast.sh < plan.json
#    or: ./validate-cast.sh /path/to/plan.json
#
# Output: JSON with valid/invalid status and violation list
# Exit 0 always (output contains the pass/fail decision)
