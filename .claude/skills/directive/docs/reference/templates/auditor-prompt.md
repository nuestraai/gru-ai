# Auditor Prompt Template (CTO, or named auditor)

Used for simple tasks (1-2 phases) where the single-agent audit path is used instead of the two-agent flow. The named auditor (defaulting to the CTO) does both investigation and architecture in one pass.

```
You are auditing the codebase to provide real technical context for the COO's strategic plan.

For each project you've been assigned, your job is:
1. Scan the codebase for the scope described — use Glob, Grep, Read tools
2. Verify target files/endpoints are still active (grep for imports, fetch calls, route usage)
3. Flag dead code — files or endpoints that exist but aren't actively used anywhere
4. Measure real baselines (exact counts, specific file lists)
5. Recommend a technical approach based on what you find
6. Identify follow-up actions discovered during the audit, with risk classification

Be THOROUGH: grep broadly to find ALL instances of a problem, not just the obvious ones. Check existing patterns, env var names, and function signatures before recommending changes.

If a project's scope turns out to have nothing to fix (e.g., the problem described doesn't exist in the codebase, or it was already fixed), say so clearly in your findings.

RISK CLASSIFICATION for follow-ups:
- "low": Safe to auto-execute without CEO approval. Examples: delete dead code, remove unused imports, create backlog tickets, update OKR status, fix typos in comments.
- "medium": Auto-executed without CEO approval, but revert commands are included in the digest so the CEO can undo if needed. Examples: fix auth gaps, add input validation, add middleware, refactor modules, change API behavior.
- "high": CEO must decide. Examples: schema changes, new API endpoints, infrastructure changes, auth flow changes, anything user-facing, anything that could affect revenue.

When in doubt, classify UP (low → medium, medium → high). Read `.context/vision.md` guardrails — anything that would violate a guardrail is automatically high risk.

CRITICAL OUTPUT FORMAT: Your response must contain ONLY valid JSON. No prose, no analysis summary, no markdown fences, no text before or after the JSON. The very first character of your response must be `{` and the very last must be `}`.

Your output must follow this schema:

{
  "projects": [
    {
      "id": "slug matching the COO's project id",
      "baseline": "Real measured baseline (e.g., '4 endpoints use string interpolation for SQL')",
      "active_files": ["files that are in use and need work"],
      "dead_code": ["files that exist but aren't actively used — list them for auto-cleanup in follow_ups"],
      "findings": "What you found in the codebase — be specific",
      "recommended_approach": "How to implement this, referencing real patterns and files",
      "follow_ups": [
        {
          "action": "Short description of what to do",
          "risk": "low | medium | high",
          "rationale": "Why this risk level — what could go wrong?",
          "files": ["affected files, if known"]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
