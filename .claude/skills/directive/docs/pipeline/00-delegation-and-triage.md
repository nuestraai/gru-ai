## Step 0b: Triage (Complexity Assessment)

### Pre-flight Cleanup

Before doing anything else, kill orphaned CLI agents from prior runs. These accumulate when a directive session gets killed mid-execution (context limit, timeout, cancellation) and the spawned child processes keep running as zombies. Left unchecked, they saturate API rate limits and cause new spawns to hang indefinitely.

```bash
# Kill orphaned CLI agent processes from prior runs
ps aux | grep "claude.*--agent.*-p" | grep -v grep | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill 2>/dev/null
# Also kill any orphaned -p (print mode) processes without --agent
ps aux | grep "claude -p" | grep -v grep | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill 2>/dev/null
echo "Pre-flight cleanup: killed orphaned agent processes"
```

This is safe — active CLI agents for the current directive haven't been spawned yet, so there's nothing to accidentally kill.

### Classify the Directive

Read the directive, then classify its weight. This determines how much process overhead is needed. Not everything needs the full pipeline.

Read the directive file: `.context/directives/$ARGUMENTS.md`
Read `.context/vision.md` guardrails and `.context/preferences.md`.

### Classification Rules

**Lightweight** — Morgan plans, but minimal overhead. No C-suite challenges, no CEO approval:
- Single clear task (fix a bug, delete dead code, update a config)
- All changes are in well-understood files
- No user-facing impact
- No guardrail risk (check vision.md)
- Scope fits in one engineer agent's work

**Medium** — Morgan plans, but no C-suite challenges, no CEO approval:
- 2-3 related tasks that need coordination
- Touches multiple files but within one system
- Low-to-medium risk (no revenue/auth/schema impact)
- Morgan plans the projects, pipeline executes tasks, CEO gets the summary

**Heavyweight** — Full pipeline with challenges, audit, and CEO approval gate:
- Crosses system boundaries (frontend + backend + infra)
- Touches revenue, auth, user data, or database schema
- Architectural decisions needed
- Violates or tests a guardrail in vision.md
- CEO has explicitly flagged this area as sensitive
- 4+ tasks or multi-day scope

**Security classification examples** (to resolve ambiguity):
- Hardening existing code (fixing injection, removing hardcoded creds, adding input validation to existing routes) = **Medium**
- Changing auth flows, adding new auth mechanisms, modifying access controls, changing session handling = **Heavyweight**

**Strategic** — Full pipeline with brainstorm phase before Morgan plans:
- Multiple valid approaches and the directive doesn't prescribe one
- Architectural or process-level change — affects HOW the system works, not just WHAT it does
- Crosses 2+ domain boundaries where C-suite members would have conflicting opinions
- Lasting consequences expensive to reverse — new schemas, API contracts, conventions
- The directive asks a question or states a problem without specifying the solution
- NOT strategic just because it's big — a directive with a clear prescribed approach is heavyweight, not strategic

### Triage Output

State the classification clearly before proceeding:

```
Directive: {name}
Classification: {lightweight | medium | heavyweight | strategic}
Reasoning: {1-2 sentences why}
Process: {what steps will be used}
```

### Lightweight Process

1. Read context files (lessons/ topic files, preferences.md — skip the full context load)
2. Spawn Morgan to plan projects (plan) — even for simple work, Morgan produces the plan so the CEO session stays clean
3. Spawn auditor for technical baseline (audit) — lightweight audit, not full investigation
4. **No plan-approval gate** — auto-approve
5. Create branch (setup) — worktree only if working directory is dirty
6. Execute tasks (execute)
7. Review verification (review-gate)
8. Generate a short digest to `.context/reports/`
9. Return CEO summary (Done / Changes / Needs CEO Eyes / Next)

No C-suite challenges. No brainstorm. No plan-approval gate. No worktree (unless the CEO has uncommitted changes). No OKR updates. CEO approves completion after the fact (completion step).

**CEO SESSION RULE: The CEO session NEVER plans or builds — it triages, delegates to Morgan/agents, and reviews results. This applies to ALL weights including lightweight.**

### Medium Process

1. Read full context (read + context steps)
2. Spawn Morgan to plan projects (plan) -- Morgan's inline challenge is always included, but skip separate C-suite challengers (challenge step)
3. Spawn auditor for technical baseline (audit)
4. **No plan-approval gate** -- auto-approve the plan based on directive scope and guardrails
5. Create branch (setup) — worktree only if working directory is dirty
6. Execute tasks (execute)
7. Review verification (review-gate)
8. Update OKRs, generate digest, update lessons (wrapup)
9. Output CEO summary

No pause for plan sign-off. The CEO reviews the digest after the fact and approves completion (completion step). If something in the plan looks risky (touches a guardrail), **upgrade to heavyweight**.

### Strategic Process

Same as heavyweight but with an additional deliberation round during brainstorm. The team figures out the approach, debates it, and the CEO answers 2-3 clarifying questions.

1. Read full context (read + context steps)
2. **Brainstorm phase (with deliberation)** — spawn the brainstorm team in parallel using `run_in_background: true`. The brainstorm team includes:
   - **2-3 relevant C-suite agents** (Sarah for architecture, Marcus for product, Priya for growth — pick based on directive domain)
   - **The named auditor** from the project cast (defaulting to Sarah if none assigned) -- grounds proposals in codebase reality

   Each agent gets:
   - Their personality from `.claude/agents/{name}.md`
   - The directive text
   - `.context/vision.md` and `.context/preferences.md`
   - The Phase 1 prompt from the brainstorm prompt template
   - `model: "sonnet"` (cheap, fast -- this is approach exploration, not code)

   ```
   Agent tool call (per brainstorm agent):
     subagent_type: "{agent_name}"
     model: "sonnet"
     run_in_background: true
     prompt: |
       {Phase 1 brainstorm prompt from template}
   ```

   **Collect results** — after spawning all brainstorm agents, collect results using TaskOutput for each agent ID. Wait for all background agents to return before synthesizing.

   **Error handling** — if a brainstorm agent fails or times out, log the error and continue with the remaining proposals. If ALL brainstorm agents fail, skip the brainstorm synthesis and proceed to Morgan planning with a note: "brainstorm phase failed — Morgan must derive the approach independently."

3. **Deliberation round (strategic only)** — after collecting all Phase 1 proposals, spawn each agent again with all proposals visible. Each agent writes ONE rebuttal targeting the proposal they most disagree with. Use the Phase 2 prompt from the brainstorm prompt template.

   ```
   Agent tool call (per brainstorm agent, round 2):
     subagent_type: "{agent_name}"
     model: "sonnet"
     run_in_background: true
     prompt: |
       {Phase 2 deliberation prompt from template, with all Phase 1 outputs included}
   ```

   **Collect rebuttals** — same collection pattern as Phase 1. If a rebuttal agent fails, continue without it.

4. **Synthesize** — collect all proposals AND rebuttals. Identify which critiques landed, which proposals survived challenge. Write synthesis to `.context/directives/{directive-id}/brainstorm.md`
5. **CEO clarification** — write 2-3 clarifying questions based on unresolved disagreements from the deliberation. STOP and return to CEO: "This directive is strategic. The team brainstormed N approaches and debated. Here are questions before we proceed: [questions]"
6. **After CEO answers** — feed brainstorm synthesis + CEO answers into Morgan's prompt as additional context. Continue as heavyweight from the plan step onward.

> See [docs/reference/schemas/brainstorm-output.md](../reference/schemas/brainstorm-output.md) for the brainstorm agent output JSON schema (proposals + rebuttals).

### Heavyweight Process

Full pipeline: triage → read → context → challenge → **Brainstorm** → plan → audit → approve → project-brainstorm → setup → execute → review-gate → wrapup → completion.

**Brainstorm phase (mandatory for heavyweight):** Before Morgan plans, spawn the brainstorm team in parallel using `run_in_background: true`. The brainstorm team includes:
- **2-3 relevant C-suite agents** (Sarah for architecture, Marcus for product, Priya for growth — pick based on directive domain)
- **The named auditor** from the project cast (defaulting to Sarah if none assigned) -- grounds proposals in codebase reality

Each agent gets the **Phase 1 prompt only** from the brainstorm prompt template. No deliberation round for heavyweight — proposals only, then synthesis.

```
Agent tool call (per brainstorm agent):
  subagent_type: "{agent_name}"
  model: "sonnet"
  run_in_background: true
  prompt: |
    {Phase 1 brainstorm prompt from template}
```

**Collect results** using TaskOutput for each agent ID. Wait for all background agents to return before synthesizing.

**Error handling** — if a brainstorm agent fails or times out, log the error and continue with the remaining proposals. If ALL brainstorm agents fail, skip the brainstorm synthesis and proceed to Morgan planning with a note: "brainstorm phase failed — Morgan must derive the approach independently."

**Synthesize** — collect all proposals (NO rebuttals for heavyweight). Identify convergence points and key disagreements. Write synthesis to `.context/directives/{directive-id}/brainstorm.md`. CEO clarification questions are included in the plan-for-approval artifact rather than as a separate STOP gate. This ensures the team thinks through the approach before Morgan plans, without adding a separate round-trip to the CEO.

> See [docs/reference/templates/brainstorm-prompt.md](../reference/templates/brainstorm-prompt.md) for the full brainstorm agent prompt template.

> See [docs/reference/schemas/brainstorm-output.md](../reference/schemas/brainstorm-output.md) for the brainstorm agent output JSON schema.

For the CEO approval gate (approve step): write the plan to `.context/directives/{directive-id}/plan-for-approval.md` and STOP. Output a summary asking the CEO to approve. Include brainstorm synthesis and any clarifying questions alongside Morgan's plan. After CEO approval, continue execution from the setup step.
